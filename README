Minor adjustments in script1.sh: using 'sed' instead of arithmetical approach.

16.05.2013
cpp and bash_script branches merged into master.
to compile filesystem.cpp use the following command:
g++ filesystem.cpp -o filesystem -lboost_system -lboost_filesystem -lboost_date_time

script1.sh outputs the current state of RAM, based on /proc/meminfo file if not given any other surce as an argument.

script2.sh compiles filesystem.cpp
